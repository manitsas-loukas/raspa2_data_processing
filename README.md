# raspa2_data_processing
Python script for parsing RASPA2 .data output files, extracting adsorption data, and exporting results into structured JSON and CSV format.

# RASPA2 Data Processing

This project contains a Python script for automatically parsing RASPA2 simulation output files (`.data` format) and extracting key adsorption properties for different MOFs and pressures. The script reads each output file, converts its contents into a dictionary, saves the raw output as .json, and finally aggregates all extracted values into a DataFrame, which is exported as data_absorption_flex.csv.

Features:
a) Average loading (absolute), Units for loading, Enthalpy of adsorption, Total energy
b) Convert simulation outputs into structured .json 
c) Supports loops over: i) multiple MOFs, ii) multiple pressures, iii) multiple simulation files
